We will use induction on the assumed proof-tree $\D$ for $\Gamma, \nabla^n (A \wedge B) \Rightarrow \Delta$, $\Gamma, \nabla^n (A \vee B) \Rightarrow \Delta$, $\Gamma, \nabla^n B, \nabla^{n+1} (A \rightarrow B) \Rightarrow \Delta$ and $\Gamma \Rightarrow A \wedge B$ for parts $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$ of Lemma, repsectively, where it ends with a rule $R$. Notice that our construction does not increase the proof size.

Cases where $R$ is an axiom are trivial. In cases where $R$ is $L \wedge$, $R \wedge$, $L \vee$ and either of $R \vee_1$ or $R \vee_2$ in parts $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$, respectively, and $A \wedge B$, $A \vee B$ and $\nabla (A \rightarrow B)$ are principal, which implies $n = 0$, the subtree(s) of $\D$ would prove the desired sequent. In all other cases just commute $R$ with $IH(D_0)$ (and $IH(D_1)$ if $R$ has two premises).
